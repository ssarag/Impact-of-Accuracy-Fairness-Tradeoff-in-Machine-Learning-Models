# Impact-of-Accuracy-Fairness-Tradeoff-in-Machine-Learning-Models
As learning models have become more advanced, concerns about fairness have become more prominent. There are many techniques in machine learning to eliminate the bias in the model and generate a model which gives predictions that are fair and accurate. The most prevalent technique in fair machine learning is to integrate fairness as a constraint or penalization term in the prediction loss minimization, which eventually limits the information provided to decision-makers. 
The main purpose of this project is to study the effect of regularization on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. This project will investigate the inherent bias of algorithms as well as evaluate fairness approaches devised to reduce prejudice, with an emphasis on accuracy deterioration, if any.
